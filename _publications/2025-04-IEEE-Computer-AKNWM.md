Computer applications can revolutionize the learning of culture and heritage. Usability and their utility as learning aids are critical for such applications. Online maps offer a modern solution to the limitations of sharing history with young generations. This paper builds an interactive web map that provides a visual learning environment for the epidemic diseases in Alaska and their impact on the Alaska Native communities.
