title: "Distributed Executions with CONTROL-CORE Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Closed-loop Neuromodulation Control Systems"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2025-05-Springer-Cluster-CONTROL-CORE
excerpt: 'Design and execution of neuromodulation control systems studies are challenging as they consist of feedback loops and often need to compose studies from programs developed in different programming languages. In our previous work, we designed CONTROL-CORE as an open-source framework for simulating closed-loop peripheral neuromodulation control systems to address this need. We implemented its prototype as CONTROL-CORE-1.0 with support for building and running such studies locally and in a distributed manner. This paper presents CONTROL-CORE-2.0, the extended version of CONTROL-CORE, converting it into an integrated development environment (IDE) for neuromodulation control systems, addressing the identified shortcomings in the prior version in terms of performance, efficient use, and functionality. Our contributions facilitate the visual creation and execution of programs and studies from them, the distributed execution of those studies in a cluster or across organizations, and the curation of community-contributed studies and programs in a centralized repository.'

Design and execution of neuromodulation control systems studies are challenging as they consist of feedback loops and often need to compose studies from programs developed in different programming languages. In our previous work, we designed CONTROL-CORE as an open-source framework for simulating closed-loop peripheral neuromodulation control systems to address this need. We implemented its prototype as CONTROL-CORE-1.0 with support for building and running such studies locally and in a distributed manner.

This paper presents CONTROL-CORE-2.0, the extended version of CONTROL-CORE, converting it into an integrated development environment (IDE) for neuromodulation control systems, addressing the identified shortcomings in the prior version in terms of performance, efficient use, and functionality. Our contributions facilitate the visual creation and execution of programs and studies from them, the distributed execution of those studies in a cluster or across organizations, and the curation of community-contributed studies and programs in a centralized repository.
