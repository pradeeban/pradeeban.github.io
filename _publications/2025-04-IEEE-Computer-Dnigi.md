Culturally sensitive education and place-based learning can facilitate the preservation of Indigenous history and culture revitalization. Research has shown the effectiveness of using serious games in active learning in various domains such as engineering, computer science, languages, history, and literature. This paper presents the research, design, and development of Dnigi, a serious game to facilitate learning Alaska Native Heritage, focusing on Dena\'ina language and history. We envision Dnigi as a learning aid, targeting an undergraduate audience as developers and users.
