This article presents our visual approach to understanding magnetic resonance imaging scanner usage in a health-care network in Atlanta, GA, USA. We build a framework that lets us
study scanner usage in near real-time and retrospectively by getting the metadata from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) images.
