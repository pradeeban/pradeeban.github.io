I have blogged extensively about my life in my [blog](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/). Some of these blogposts follow a theme as a series.

Travels
======
I like traveling and experiencing diverse cultures. 

I have lived in 7 countries: Sri Lanka, Portugal, Sweden, Croatia, USA, Belgium, and Saudi Arabia. 

I have traveled in 47 countries as shown in this beautiful map. Read the [full list](travels.html) of my travels.

I like to visit all the countries in the world. I maintain a [list of top 20 countries that I love to visit soon](bucket-list.html).

_Memories of_ series
======
* [Memories of Sri Lanka](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/2019/03/memories-of-sri-lanka.html)
  * This is a quick looking back into my life in Sri Lanka (1987 - 2012) and thoughts along those lines.
  * A detailed discussion of my undergrad days is in the [Memories of UoM](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/search/label/UoM_memories) 3-episode series.

* [Memories of Portugal](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/search/label/Lisboa_memories)
  * This is the most detailed writing among my "Memories of" series. This is a 5-episode series, as I was in-and-out of Portugal, 2012 - 2019.
  * As Lisboa was my host city (and my first city to live abroad) throughout my MSc and Ph.D. it made sense for a long series of post.

* [Memories of Sweden](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/2019/03/memories-of-sweden.html)
  * A brief post compared to Portugal since I lived in Sweden for just one semester of my MSc, although visited three times in 2010s.

* [Memories of Croatia](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/2015/09/memories.html)
  * Although just a month, Croatia left a lasting impact and an on-going collaboration reaching a decade.

* Memories of USA
  * This is actually a future series since I prefer to write a series only from looking back. 
  * The first post/episode on this series will be Memories of Atlanta, which I will write once I left Atlanta.
  * A series on the Pandemic days of 2020 in Atlanta: [Week 42 - Week 12](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/search?q=pandemic-atlanta-lockdown&max-results=50&by-date=true) and [Week 11 - Week 1](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/search?q=pandemic-atlanta-lockdown&updated-max=2020-06-06T19:15:00%2B01:00&max-results=50&start=25&by-date=true).
  
* [Memories of Belgium](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/2019/03/memories-of-belgium.html)
  * I spent most of my 2017 in Belgium, as the second university of my Ph.D. was in Belgium.
  
* [Memories of Saudi Arabia](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/2017/12/experience-of-2-months-at-kaust-saudi.html)
  * It was just two months. So a brief blog post.
  
_A few things that made my YEAR interesting.._ series
======

* [This](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/search/label/Annual%20Post) is a series of blog posts that I write annually.
  * Each blog post is a collection of 30 items, remarking a happy event or an achievement of the year.
  * I have written this annual post since 2010, usually in the last week of December.
  * A few years were exciting (for example, 2019, 2017, and 2015) and I was struggling to find which of the events to exclude from the post to limit to 30 things. Other years (such as 2018) were less eventful.
  
_A few things that made my DECADE interesting.._ series
======

* [This](https://kkpradeeban.blogspot.com/search/label/Decade%20Post) is a series (?) of blog posts that I hope to write every 10 years.
  * Each blog post is a collection of 30 items, remarking a happy event or an achievement of the decade.
  * My first decade post was for 2010s, written in December 2019. 2010s has been my most eventful and exciting decade.
  * Not sure whether this will become a series. We need to wait until 2029 for that.
