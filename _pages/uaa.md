## Project Ideas List for CSCE A470 and CSCE A498

The document below provides a list of project ideas, aiming to satisfy the course requirements for CSCE A470 and CSCE A498.

<iframe src="../files/uaa-projects-list.pdf" width="100%" height="545px"></iframe>

CSCE A470 is the Capstone Project.

CSCE A498 is Individual Research 1-3 Credits. It may be repeated up to a maximum of 6 credits. Students will engage in an independent research project listed below. The result will be a paper or presentation prepared to publication standards.

All the listed project ideas (both CSCE A498 and CSCE A470) are expected to be developed as open-source frameworks using GitHub. LaTeX is proposed to write the research work into a paper. Overleaf provides an easy online deployment and collaborative environment for LaTeX. Until the research paper is published/submitted or until the source code is in a better shape, the GitHub repository can be left private.

If you are a UAA CS&E student who likes to work with me for one of these courses, please reach out to me if you do not have a password to access this file.
