I am Pradeeban, an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Alaska Anchorage (UAA). 

My research interests include distributed computing, wide-area networks, big data federation, Internet measurements, Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), and active learning in computer science education. I work on projects that apply these research aspects to the circumpolar north on diverse topics such as healthcare equity in rural Alaska, telehealth access in healthcare deserts, polar science, and Alaska Native Studies. I also enjoy mentoring undergraduates in open-source and research.

Before joining UAA, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University. I have an EU Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Distributed Computing (EMJD-DC) from INESC-ID Lisboa / Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal and Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium.
