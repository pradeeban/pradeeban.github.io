Hi! I am Pradeeban, a Postdoctoral Researcher and Senior Systems Software Engineer at the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. I build efficient frameworks to schedule and execute biomedical informatics workflows, such as radiology imaging streams and neuroscience pipelines, in research clusters and hybrid clouds. I am currently researching wide area network enhancements for telehealth access in healthcare deserts.

I have an EU Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Distributed Computing (EMJD-DC) from INESC-ID Lisboa / Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal and Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium. My Ph.D. thesis was on Software-Defined Systems for network-aware service composition and workflow placement. I received my MSc degree, Erasmus Mundus European Master in Distributed Computing (EMDC), from Instituto Superior Técnico, Portugal, and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

My research interests include distributed systems, network softwarization, telehealth, big data integration, Internet measurements, and Service-Oriented Architecture. I also have extensive experience working on open-source projects and mentoring a diverse range of students on programs such as Google Summer of Code (GSoC) since 2010.
