I am Pradeeban, an incoming Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Alaska Anchorage. My research will focus on networking and big data innovations for healthcare, specifically for telehealth access and equity in the circumpolar north.

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher and Senior Systems Software Engineer at the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, USA. I build efficient frameworks to schedule and execute biomedical informatics workflows, such as radiology imaging streams and neuroscience pipelines, in research clusters and hybrid clouds. I am researching wide area network enhancements for telehealth access in healthcare deserts.

I have an EU Erasmus Mundus Joint Doctorate in Distributed Computing (EMJD-DC) from INESC-ID Lisboa / Instituto Superior Técnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Portugal and Université catholique de Louvain, Belgium. My Ph.D. thesis was on Software-Defined Systems for network-aware service composition and workflow placement. I received my MSc degree, Erasmus Mundus European Master in Distributed Computing (EMDC), from Instituto Superior Técnico, Portugal, and KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Sweden.

My research interests are where distributed computing and biomedical informatics meet. This includes network softwarization, telehealth, big data integration, Internet measurements, and Service-Oriented Architecture. In recent years, I have researched and implemented distributed systems for various healthcare domains, such as radiology and neuroscience. I also enjoy working on open-source projects and mentoring students on programs such as Google Summer of Code (GSoC).
