I am a FOSS enthusiast. Google Summer of Code (GSoC) is a remote open-source summer internship program where contributors work with an open-source organization while receiving a stipend from Google.

I have participated in the GSoC as a contributor (AbiWord: 2009, OMII-UK: 2010, Emory BMI: 2014, and Emory BMI: 2015), mentor (AbiWord: 2011, AbiWord: 2013, and Emory-BMI: 2016), and an organization administrator (Emory-BMI: 2019, 2021 - 2023; caMicroscope: 2020; and Alaska: 2024 - Present).  I also participated in Google Code-In (a program that trained high-school students in open source) as a mentor (with Haiku, 2011 and 2012). I was also a contributor with OpenDaylight Summer Internship (2015).

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

This presentation introduces [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) based on my experience with these internship programs.

Please note the contributor application deadline is usually around the first week of April. Please follow the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and submit your project proposals on the GSoC site.

## Community Bonding Period?

I also have a "Part-II" presentation. This brief presentation specifically targets contributors who have just been accepted into GSoC, so it is for the so-called Community Bonding period.
