I am a free and open source software (FOSS) enthusiast. 
[KathiraveluLab](https://github.com/kathiravelulab) hosts our recent research developments.

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

The presentation below provides an introduction to [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), an annual open-source summer internship program funded by Google, where contributors work remotely with their favorite open-source organizations.

Please note the application deadline is usually around the first week of April each year. Please follow the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) correctly and submit your project proposals on the GSoC site.

I represent the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University (Emory BMI), as the organization administrator for the GSoC (2019 - 2023).
