I am a free and open-source software (FOSS) enthusiast. I have participated in the remote open-source summer internship programs: Google Summer of Code (GSoC: as a contributor, mentor, and organization administrator), Google Code-In (as a mentor), and OpenDaylight Summer Internship (as a contributor). In these programs, contributors work remotely with their favorite open-source organizations. 

I have participated in the GSoC as a contributor (AbiWord/2009, OMII-UK/2010, Emory BMI/2014, and Emory BMI/2015), mentor (AbiWord/2011, AbiWord/2013, and Emory-BMI/2016), and an organization administrator (Emory-BMI: 2019, 2021 - 2023; caMicroscope: 2020; and Alaska: 2024). 

This presentation introduces [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/),

Please note the contributor application deadline is usually around the first week of April. Please follow the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and submit your project proposals on the GSoC site.

## Community Bonding Period?

I also have a "Part-II" presentation. This brief presentation specifically targets contributors who have just been accepted into GSoC, so it is for the so-called Community Bonding period.
