## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

I am a free and open-source software (FOSS) enthusiast. I am the organization administrator for [Alaska](https://github.com/uaanchorage/gsoc) in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). I mentor a few project ideas for Alaska in the GSoC.

The presentation below introduces [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), an annual open-source summer internship program funded by Google, where contributors work remotely with their favorite open-source organizations.

Please note the contributor application deadline is usually around the first week of April. Please follow the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and submit your project proposals on the GSoC site.
