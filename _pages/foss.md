## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

I am a free and open-source software (FOSS) enthusiast. I am also the organization administrator for "Alaska" in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC).

The presentation below introduces [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), an annual open-source summer internship program funded by Google, where contributors work remotely with their favorite open-source organizations. 

[Alaska GSoC](https://github.com/uaanchorage/gsoc) is the list of project ideas that are part of the GSoC as the organization, "Alaska." It also includes some open-source projects I am working on.

Please note the contributor application deadline is usually around the first week of April. Please follow the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and submit your project proposals on the GSoC site.
