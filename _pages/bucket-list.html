I enjoy random walks in various countries and cities. I like villages and cities in the border, and how the borders change the landscape, life styles, and everything. I loved my border crossings by land, the most, including, USA - Mexico,  Croatia - Serbia, Croatia - Slovenia, Romania - Hungary, and many other EU border crossings (that do not really exist thanks to Schengen).<br>
<br>
I like to eventually visit all the countries in the world. This page lists the countries and regions that I like to visit in the near future, and those countries that I managed to visit from my bucket list.<br>
