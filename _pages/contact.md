Please email me for collaboration, if our research interests align.

If you are a University of Alaska Anchorage student, you should have direct access to my office hours.
You can come and find me at ECB 308G most of the time during the weekdays, except when I am at a class or an external meeting/event.

If you like to meet me outside the office hours, please look at my calendar for my availability and send an invitation to my alaska.edu email address.

This calendar is usually complete and upto date. 

If you are from the Outside, we can meet remotely over the Zoom. Please note that my timezone is Anchorage/Alaska.
