Dena'inaq e≈Çnenaq' gheshtnu ch'q'u yeshdu. I live and work on the land of the Dena'ina.

I like collaborations and inter-disciplinary research. If you are reading this, it is likely that we have common interests. I like to hear from you.

If you are a University of Alaska student, staff, or faculty, you should have direct access to my office hours.
You can come and find me at ECB 308G most of the weekdays, except when I am at a class or an external meeting/event.

If you like to meet me outside the office hours, please look at my calendar for my availability and send a calendar invitation to my email address.
