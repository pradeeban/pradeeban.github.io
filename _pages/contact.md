Feel free to email me if you like to collaborate with me. My email is in the left panel.

If you are a University of Alaska Anchorage student, you should have direct access to my office hours. Find me at ECB 308G.

You can find me at ECB 308G most of the time during the weekdays, except when I am at a class or an external meeting/event.

If you like to meet me outside the office hours, please look at my calendar for my availability and send an invitation to my alaska.edu email address.

This calendar is usually complete and upto date.

If you are from the Outside, please note that my timezone is Anchorage/Alaska.
