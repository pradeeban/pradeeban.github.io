My research interests are where distributed computing and biomedical informatics meet. In recent years, I have researched and implemented distributed systems for various healthcare domains, such as radiology, telehealth, and neuroscience.


## Open-Source Projects

Listed below are a few open-source projects that I built as a core researcher and developer.

* [Niffler](https://github.com/Emory-HITI/Niffler/)
* [CONTROL-CORE](https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/)
* [Bindaas](https://github.com/sharmalab/bindaas)
* [Robin](https://github.com/pradeeban/robin)

Your contributions are welcome to these projects.

I also represent the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University (Emory BMI), as the organization administrator and a mentor for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Please look at the project ideas to find a project that you like to work on during the summer.
