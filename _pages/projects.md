I am open source enthusiast. I represent the Department of Biomedical Informatics, Emory University (Emory BMI), as the organization administrator and a mentor for the Google Summer of Code (GSoC). 

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

The presentation below provides an introduction to GSoC, a virtual open-source summer internship project funded by Google, where contributors work remotely with their favorite open-source organizations.
