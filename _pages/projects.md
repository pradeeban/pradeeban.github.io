I am a free and open-source software (FOSS) enthusiast. [KathiraveluLab](https://github.com/kathiravelulab/) hosts our recent research developments that are open source.

## Google Summer of Code (GSoC)

The presentation below introduces [Google Summer of Code (GSoC)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/), an annual open-source summer internship program funded by Google, where contributors work remotely with their favorite open-source organizations.  [Alaska GSoC Ideas](https://github.com/uaanchorage/gsoc) have some open-source project ideas I am interested in.

Please note the contributor application deadline is usually around the first week of April. Please follow the [timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) and submit your project proposals on the GSoC site.
