[KathiraveluLab](https://github.com/kathiravelulab/) hosts our recent open-source developments.

If you are applying to Google Summer of Code (GSoC) or another open-source remote internship or are a new contributor or mentor, you may find my [presentations](../_pages/foss.html) useful.

Other notable open-source projects that I built as a core researcher and developer:
* [Niffler](https://github.com/Emory-HITI/Niffler/): A DICOM retrieval and processing framework
* [CONTROL-CORE](https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/): Design and simulation framework for neuromodulation control systems.
* [Bindaas](https://github.com/sharmalab/bindaas/): A data access federation middleware framework.
