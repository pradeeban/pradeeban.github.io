[KathiraveluLab](https://github.com/kathiravelulab/) hosts our recent research developments that are open source.

## Open Source

Below are a few open-source projects that I built as a core researcher and developer.

* [Niffler](https://github.com/Emory-HITI/Niffler/): A DICOM retrieval and processing framework
* [CONTROL-CORE](https://github.com/ControlCore-Project/): Design and simulation framework for neuromodulation control systems.
* [Bindaas](https://github.com/sharmalab/bindaas/): A data access federation middleware framework.
* [Robin](https://github.com/KathiraveluLab/robin/): An A/B Proxy

# If you are looking forward to applying to Google Summer of Code (GSoC) or a similar open-source remote internship or are a new contributor or mentor, you may find my [Presentations](../_pages/foss.html) useful.
